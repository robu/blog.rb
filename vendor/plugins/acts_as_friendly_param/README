	Friendly Param
	==============

	A Ruby on Rails plugin that swaps the commonly used numeric :id
	based URLs (/posts/34), for more useful & human readable URLs 
	like (/posts/34-my-latest-spoon-collection)

	Usage
	=====

	declare a field in your model that you wish to use for the textual
	slug with the acts_as_friendly_param macro.

	class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
	  acts_as_friendly_param :name
	end

	That's it!

	The result of the Post#name method will be appended to the URL

	helpers like:

	<%= link_to 'view post', :action => 'show', :id => @post %>

	will produce URLs like

	/posts/12-monkies-are-coming



	Unicode Concerns
	================

	Although many unicode characters are actually valid in URIs, the
	rails url helpers are quite strict with their escaping and you can
	end up with some pretty ugly urls.
	It is also good for searching if e and Ã© are treated equally.

	So.. friendly-param will try to tidy up the following:

	* remove any accents from characters
	* strip out any plain-crazy characters (Omega, Pi etc)
	* convert spaces into hyphens



	SEO Concerns
	============

	To prevent multiple URLs pointing to the same resource, and having
	a negative effect on search-engine ranking, friendly-url will
	use 301 redirects on any ambiguous GET requests.

	The following behavior should be expected

	* trailing slashes will be removed from URLs
	* requests for resources using incorrect slugs will be redirected
	  to the the correct URL
	* if the routes file is drastically modified then any old URLs that 
	  still work will be redirected to there new equivalent. 




	Gotchas
	=======

	Once a model has is acting as a friendly param then #find will not
	act the same for String/Fixnum objects.

	Post.find('8')  =>> RecordMoved Error 
	Post.find(8) 		=>> OK

	Ensure that you use don't call #id directly when using url_for

	eg.

	<%= link_to 'show animal', :action => 'show', :id => @animal %>

	NOT

	<%= link_to 'show animal', :action => 'show', :id => @animal.id %>
